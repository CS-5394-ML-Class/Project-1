# Project-1



## Running The Model
To run the model, use the following command:
```python3 Proj2.py```


## Picking A Running Mode
There are 3 modes the model can be ran in:
- Train Sigmoid - Train the sigmoid model
- Run Sigmoid - Run the sigmoid model using predefined parameters

To pick a model, change the last line to one of the three following lines of code:
- ```train_sigmoid()``` to train the sigmoid model
- ```run_sigmoid()``` to run the sigmoid model with predefined parameters

<bold>NOTE: </bold> For the ```run_sigmoid()``` mode, if you wish to change the predefined model parameters, you can do so at the beginiing of the ```run_sigmoid()``` function.


## Requirements
Below are the required libraries to run the program with the library versions that are guaranteed to run the program.
- PyTorch==1.8.1
- Matplotlib==3.4.2
- NumPy==1.19.5
- Pandas==1.2.4

Additionally, the following python version was used to test the program. Any version around the following version should be able to run the program.
- Python version ```3.8.10```
