Sigmoid:
- Problems:
  - The function looks to be fiting toward the center of the data too much
    which makes the upper bound of the fitted curve below the upper
    vound of the data curve
- Correction factors:
  - The population value is divided by 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) to help
    the function become more precise in fitting the data.
  - c5 is -1990 to move the function right by 1990 so the function can be closer
    to the data (which is from 1960-2020)
  - c7 is 5.0 to move the function up a little so that it can better fit the
    data as the data is centered about 5
  - The alpha (learning rate) is decreased from the original value to
    0 in order to help it learn slower during the later parts of training
    to keep the learning mroe stable.



Neural Network:
- Problems:
  - (Not anymore) The network had a really, really hard time fitting the data.
    To fix this, the network was made really deep.
- Correction factors:
  - The population value is divided by 10,000,000 (10 million) to help
    the function become more precise in fitting the data but also keep
    some variance in the population values so the network has more room
    for error.
  - ReLU is used to help convince the model to not go below 0
  - The alpha (learning rate) is decreased from the original value to
    0 in order to help it learn slower during the later parts of training
    to keep the learning more stable.
